<h1>Bellum Points system</h1>

<p>Before start speaking about points, an explanation about indexes affecting points should be
done. After that, you may also check the <a href="/tasks.html">task explanation page</a>
in order to understand why some tasks has no points for some ground or air kills.

<h3>Experience Index</h3>

<p>Experience index is a way to show how good is your </b>actual virtual pilot</b>. When
you start a new virtual pilot carreer (first mission, or first mission after kia/mia) you
pilot experience is set to 1 (or 100%). Then, while you keep this pilot alive, experience
grows. It will never decrease. In table below you can see what actions or events makes
changes on your pilot experience. Once pilot dies, experience turns back to 1 (or 100%).

<p>

</center>

<p>This index will affect the points won in mission. For example, if your pilot experience
after 8 sorties alive is 1.23 (123%), the mission points are increased by 23%. The bad
news are that at same time your experience grows, the <b>prize for your head</b> increase
too. This is because on every airkill, the points won are affected by the killed pilot
expereince. 

<p>Lets say you fly a mission, and you will get 10 points for each fighter. If you kill an
AI_Veteran (experience 0.8 or 80%) you will get only 8 points. And if you kill an expert
human, suppose a pilot with experience valued 1.68 (or 168%), you will get 17 points.

<p>This index makes 2 things. One is to foment you keep alive your virtual pilot, this way
you win more points. Other things is to set the amount points for an airkill. We all know
is not the same to kill a bot or a human. So, we have <b><i>dynamic</i></b> scores per kill,
based on pilot experience.

<p>When you rescue a pilot, you experience grow by 0.1 (10%), because you learn from the
pilot you just saved.

<h3>FairPlay Index</h3>

<p>Fairplay index works like the experience one, but with some differences. One is that
Fairplay index max value is 100%. This represents how much you follow recommendations.
In Bellum is not against rules to use smoke or kill chutes. But, as most people dislike
this things, every time an action "not recommended" is detected, the fairplay will
decrease.

<p>Below table shows how much some actions decrease the fairplay index. The total points
of mission is affected by this index.

<p>

<p>So, this index is like an automatic punishment. It recovers in steps of 5% if you fly
without breaking recommendations. If you want to get all points from missions, you better
keep this index at 100%. This is also required to get medals. If you reach the point to
get a medal and your fairplay is not 100%, medal is delayed till you get 100% fairplay.


<p>When you rescue a pilot, you fairplay is set to 100%, as a bonus.

<h3>Kill points</h3>


<p>Next table show the amount of points for each kill depending your mission task.

<h3>Mission points by task</h3>


<p>Next table show the amount of points based on your task. Each task has a different
condition, so in Bellum can have in same side different results. If you are escorting a
group of bombers, and all them come back alive, you get max points because that. At same
time, bombers need to hit the target to get more mission points.
